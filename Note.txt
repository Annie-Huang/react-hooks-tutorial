React Hooks Tutorial - 2 - useState Hook


=================================================================================



1. Why Hooks
#############################
javascript class problem:
Understand how this keywor workds in Javascript is difficult
Remember to bind even handlers in class components.
Classes don't minify very well and make hot relaoding very unreliable

React problem:
There is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
HOC and render props patterns do address this problem
Makes the code harder to follow
There is a need to share stateful logic in a better way

Also:
Create components for complex scenarios suhc as data fetching and subscribing to events
Related code is not organized in one place
Ex: Data fetching - In componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
Ex: Event listeners - In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount.
Because of stateful logic - Cannot break components into smaller ones

Summary:
Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8
They allow you to use React features without having to write a class
Avoid the whole confusion with 'this' keyword.
Allow you to reuse stateful logic
Organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolluated unit.

2. Rules of Hooks
#############################
Only call hooks at the Top Level: Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
Only call Hooks from React Functions:
    Call them from within React functional components and not just any regular JavaScript functions.
